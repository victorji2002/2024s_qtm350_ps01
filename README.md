The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a predictive model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on historical data. 

Specifically, we would conduct a Binary Classification Prediction Model that can detect fraudulent transactions in the future, aiming to minimize financial losses and enhance banking security.
