# Project Title: Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning in Python

## Description
In today's digital world, financial transactions are increasingly internet-dependent, leading to development in banking technologies. However, the technological revolution has also resulted in more fraudulent activities. Thus, to address this threat, our project will focus on developing a fraud detection system using machine learning models in Python and try to improve banking safety.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a predictive model that can accurately distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on historical data. 

Specifically, we would conduct a Binary Classification Prediction Model that can detect fraudulent transactions in the future, aiming to minimize financial losses and enhance banking security.

## Challenges and how they were overcome?
The biggest challenge we faced was that we worked on the readme file at the same time in our own branch for the first time, and we created two pull requests at the same time. This created an unresolvable merge on GitHub.

We try to overcome this challenge after learning that merge operations should happen sequentially, not simultaneously. We restarted the process and fix the issue.
